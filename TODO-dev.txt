New features (by tentative priority):

- CF13 Homomorphic MAC: implement read/write functions

- RNG: now it is based on RELIC rand_bytes. We could make it library-independent, e.g., by reading /dev/urandom

- Add implementation of CF13b Homomorphic MAC

- Add implementation of one linearly-homomorphic signature (e.g., CFW12)
